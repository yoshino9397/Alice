            <h2>The Ghostfence: The Shrine of Pride</h2>
            <p>
              The Ghostfence is a lasting symbol of the indomitable will and
              power of ALMSIVI, and a monument to Dunmer pride in overcoming its
              enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Pride is found within the Ghostfence, just northeast
              of the Ghostgate itself. The safest route to Ghostgate is along
              the Foyada Mamaea, a volcanic ravine running from the top of Red
              Mountain southwest to its end just below Balmora. An old Dwemer
              bridge crosses the foyada near Fort Moonmoth. A pilgrim may follow
              the Foyada Mamaea all the way to Ghostgate. Any journey inside the
              Ghostfence is dangerous, but even the most timid pilgrim should be
              safe, so long as he does not stray too far from the Ghostgate and
              flees from any minions of Dagoth Ur. When you address the shrine,
              it is customary to leave a soul gem in remembrance of our
              ancestors who were bound to the Tribunal's service.
