              When Sheogorath rebelled against the Tribunal, he tricked the moon
              Baar Dau into forsaking its appointed path through Oblivion. The
              Mad Star inspired the moon to hurl itself upon Vivec's new city,
              which Sheogorath claimed was built in mockery of the heavens. When
              Vivec learned of Sheogorath's scheme, he froze the rogue moon in
              the sky with a single gesture and the grace of his countenance.
              Overwhelmed by the courage and daring of Vivec, the moon Baar Dau
              swore itself to eternal service of the Tribunal and all its works.
              Thus the moon now stands guard over the palace, and serves as a
              citadel for the Temple's Ordinators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Daring is found in the city of Vivec, in the Temple
              District, along the western wall of the High Fane, the great
              Temple of Vvardenfell. When you address the shrine, it is
              customary to leave behind a Potion of Rising Force. Suitable
              potions may be purchased from the Temple. Homemade potions are not
              acceptable.

            <h2>The Puzzle Canal: The Shrine of Courtesy</h2>
            <p>
              In a battle with Mehrunes Dagon, Vivec gave his own silver
              longsword to the Daedra Lord rather than dishonor himself by
              fighting an unarmed foe. This so impressed the Dremora, the most
              honorable and chivalrous of Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric servants,
              that they now share a bond of respect and courtesy with the
              followers of the Tribunal, though we must never forget that they
              are our enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Courtesy is found in the heart of the Puzzle Canal,
              a labyrinth beneath Lord Vivec's Palace in the city of Vivec. The
              journey though the Puzzle Canal can be confusing and it is
              suggested that common pilgrims carry a scroll of ALMSIVI
              Intervention in case they get lost. The Dremora Krazzt is found in
              the center of the Puzzle Canal, and will accept a plain silver
              longsword if spoken to with courtesy. After Krazzt accepts the
              sword, pilgrims must read the inscription on the triolith.

            <h2>The Mask of Vivec: Shrine of Justice</h2>
            <p>
              Near the altar is Vivec's Ash Mask. In the Days of Fire when
              Dagoth Ur first crept back into Red Mountain and awakened it,
              Vivec led refugees here as they fled the ash and blight. Weary,
              they rested here a while. When Vivec awoke, he found himself and
              all his followers encased in casts of grey ash. Frozen like a
              sleeping statue and unable to free himself or help his people,
              Vivec was filled with despair. Vivec's tears weakened his ash
              cast. He tore the ash from his perished followers, breathed life
              into their lungs, and cured them of the blight. This is Vivec's
              heroism -- his tender heart provides strength when his might
              fails.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Justice is guarded within the Gnisis Temple, in the
              village of Gnisis, northwest by road from the town of Ald'ruhn.
              When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a potion of
              Cure Common Disease as a token of your respect for justice.
              Suitable potions may be purchased from Temple. Homemade potions
              are not acceptable.

            <h2>Koal Cave: The Shrine of Valor</h2>
            <p>
              Within the Koal Cave, Vivec fought a battle with Ruddy Man, the
              father of the Dreugh. When he defeated Ruddy Man, Vivec spared his
              life, on the condition that Ruddy Man and his children would give
              up their tough hides to serve as armor for the Dunmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Valor is inside the Koal Cave, a cavern on the
              seacoast west of the ancient stronghold Berandas and south of
              Gnisis. The cave mouth faces south, towards the sea, and is marked
              by a large natural arch of stone. The region is wilderness, and
              finding the cave mouth can be difficult. Dreugh within the cave
              itself are fearsome enemies; only experienced and capable
              adventurers should attempt to re-enact the epic battle with the
              dreugh in the cave. Dreugh wax may be bought at the Temple in
              Gnisis. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a
              portion of dreugh wax as a token of Vivec's victorious struggle
              with Ruddy Man.

            <h2>The Ghostfence: The Shrine of Pride</h2>
            <p>
              The Ghostfence is a lasting symbol of the indomitable will and
              power of ALMSIVI, and a monument to Dunmer pride in overcoming its
              enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shrine of Pride is found within the Ghostfence, just northeast
              of the Ghostgate itself. The safest route to Ghostgate is along
              the Foyada Mamaea, a volcanic ravine running from the top of Red
              Mountain southwest to its end just below Balmora. An old Dwemer
              bridge crosses the foyada near Fort Moonmoth. A pilgrim may follow
              the Foyada Mamaea all the way to Ghostgate. Any journey inside the
              Ghostfence is dangerous, but even the most timid pilgrim should be
              safe, so long as he does not stray too far from the Ghostgate and
              flees from any minions of Dagoth Ur. When you address the shrine,
              it is customary to leave a soul gem in remembrance of our
              ancestors who were bound to the Tribunal's service.
